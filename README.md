# Doodles-as-A-Service Repo

[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

👋 Aloha, this is where you can grab most of my tech doodles and sketchnotes.

I have been posting my tech doodles on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/girlie_mac) and [Microsoft open-source projects](https://github.com/microsoft/) and I am repeatedly asked where to get the original images, especially from people who saw some of my works out of context on some social media, so I decided to put all together on one GitHub repo.

Here are some of the latest digitally created handdrawn doodles, as well as photos of analog ones.

All my doodles are under Creative Commons license, so please share with attributions. And I definitely don't want you to NFT them without my permission (and I won't permit you because you don't own them. They are open-sourced to be freely available for educational purpose only!)

Enjoy 🌺

## HTTP Status Cats 🐱

This is one of my first personal project to make technology into cats. Although this is *not* doodling, I thought it was worth mentioning here!

All HTTP Cats are now hosted at [HTTP.cat](https://http.cat) because the domain name is awesome.

All images (except a few) are originally created by me a decade ago! Read the story on [Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/http-status-cats)

## Slack API Zine
[/slack](/slack)

```
└── 📁slack  
    └── 📄...

```

These are something I did while working at Slack. I created the zine (as physical printed books) to be distribute at Slack-sponsored events and conferences, but never get fully approved. Well, the global pandemic forced us to give up all in-person events anyway.

The content is outdated as of 2022 so view them with cautions.

## 🖨 Printing

> ⚠️ Updated on August 27, 2021: 
> 
> GitHub warned me that my Git LFS is disabled as the bandwidth exceeded  exceeded your data plan by 150%+.
> So now the high-res version in TIFF is temporary unavailable. I will move them somewhere when I have time. 
> Thank you! 
> 🙇‍♀️

~~The *tiff* files are for printing. I set them in 5.83 x 8.27 inches, which should fit in A5 paper size.
They are large files and stored as LFS files so you won't download the actual files when you `git clone` so please download manually from GitHub.~~
